    <h2>About This Page</h2>
    <p>
        This is a very basic HTML page created to demonstrate simple structure.
        It includes only a few essential elements and avoids any styling or
        advanced layout features. The goal is to keep everything clean,
        readable, and easy to understand.
    </p>

    <h2>More Information</h2>
    <p>
        The page uses only h1, h2, and p tags to organize the content.
        Even without CSS, HTML provides a clear structure that helps
        separate headings from paragraphs. This makes the content
        accessible and properly organized.
